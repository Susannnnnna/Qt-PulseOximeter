# Pulse Oximeter and Health Monitoring App
## Objective
This project encompasses two key components:
1. **Health Tracking Application**: A user-friendly app that allows individuals to record essential health-related data.
2. **Pulse Oximeter Integration**: An electronic device that measures and collects data on pulse rate and SpO2 levels, seamlessly saving this information within the application.

The collected data is visualized in simple, intuitive charts, helping users monitor their health and spot potential abnormalities over time.

## Key results
