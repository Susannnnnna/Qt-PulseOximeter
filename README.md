# App with Bluetooth Low Energy & Pulse Sensor
## Objective
This project encompasses two key components:
1. **Simple GUI App**: a user-friendly GUI that allow you to monitor your heart rate with extra knowledge about circulatory system and pulse
2. **BLE & Pulse Sensor Integration**: data read from the heart rate sensor is sent to the application via the BLE module.

## Key results
### **Health Tracking Application**
Below is an overview of the main components currently available in the app, along with their development status.


| App Components | Module name | Description | Status | Module Main File | 
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Current Pulse and Charts Module | BloodPressureScreen.qml | Shows current pulse and a vizualization of the pulse on a graph | In progress | PulseSensorDataScreen.qml |
| Data Module | DataScreen.qml | Pulse and time data. | In progress | PulseSensorScreen.qml |
| Knowledge Module | KnowledgeScreen.qml | Knowledge about circulatory system and pulse. | In progress | InformationScreen.qml |

### **Pulse Sensor and BLE Integration**

Details about the integration will be available soon on the Instructables page.
